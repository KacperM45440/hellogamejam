    m_Localized: "Dear brother,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that our grandfather has passed
      away. I know you've been very close and this must be a tough time for you -
      please accept my sincere condolences.\nHowever, it has also come to my attention
      that you have inherited our grandfather's suitcase, back from the times when
      he was still an adventure hunter, complete with all of the equipment.\n\nLet
      me reassure you - all of the tales about great journeys, treasure and discovery
      were just that. Tales. Please, DO NOT think of this as an opportunity to step
      into his shoes and possibly risk your own life over whatever it is that you
      can find.\nYou're always welcome in our home, and you're free to visit whenever
      you change your mind. I hope you'll see this isn't the right path for you.\n                                   
      Yours truly,"
